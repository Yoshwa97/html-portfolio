<h1>About Me</h1>

  I am fortunate to be a proud husband and father. I tend to enjoy the simple things like lifting weights, BJJ and riding 
  my cruiser. Playing the drums was never favoured by neighbours, they may be due for a wake up? These are a few things I 
  enjoy and if it is not something to relax and reset, it's creative problem solving I really enjoy.

  Recently discovering I like learning to code and the creative problem solving it promises, has me dreaming to pursue this 
  professionally. The pressure I feel applied within my current work role, particularly days when on multiple fronts from 
  multiple sources from recurring problems despite well established solutions. Attributable to our own high-five division 
  but, I don’t blame them. To be celebrated and work with impunity is hardly an incentive for change. Though a nagging 
  question becomes louder for me- Can I find better problems to solve? This begins my journey to realise but, is it too late 
  for me to learn and earn from code in a sustainable way?

  My career has largely been as an electrician. Industrial construction the majority of the first decade, coal loaders, 
  washeries, power stations etc. some underground and some commercial projects too. My switchboard panel wiring was 
  definitely my zen place. I transitioned into an estimating role when the opportunity presented itself, until investment 
  for local projects had ceased in 2012. There was literally nothing to tender on.
</p>
<p>
  With little construction within cooee, I jumped back on the tools and became self-employed. The niche market I opted for 
  in NSW is known as a level 2 Accredited Service Provider (ASP2). Authorising me on the Ausgrid network and sub-contract 
  works served me well for a time but, another niche was required.

  I became solar & battery storage accredited and an employee once again, to learn this new niche. I haven't stopped learning 
  either between the changing technologies so with good money, good people and more problem solving than I could poke a stick 
  at, I’ve been there over 5 years now. Initial few years were near 50/50 split in and out of the office, but we have grown so 
  much. I have outsourced the ASP2 work and despite being in the office full time, the sheer volume of high-fives brings 
  cumulative, recurring needless problems to solve. The question keeps getting louder so I commenced an online Web Dev course..
