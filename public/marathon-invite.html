<h1>Two Dreamers Think, They.. Can Run a Marathon!?</h1>
<h2>Flock to Mock - Sunday 17th September</h2>
<hr />
<h3>RACE DISTANCE</h3>
<h4>42.195km (World Athletics Platinum Label Marathon)</h4>
<br />
<p>The dreamers now forging the athlete mentality and discipline whilst shedding years of stored general malaise, may be 
    stretching the term 'athlete' a little. May just be kidding themselves about being in our prime? Ahem.
</p>
<p>I have run once.. recently. More of a jog really like a 5 min walk, followed by a 10 min jog, twice. Yep, back to back- on a 
    treadmill..two days ago and Iâ€™m still a little sore. 42 kms with 10 weeks to go so, Iâ€™ll <s>crush it</s> finish within 
    the 7 hr course cut-off limit. 
</p>
<p>This challenge is inspired by Bedros Keuilian, whom I am grateful for not only putting great content on YouTube but providing me 
    the 6 week challenge training & nutrition guides.
</p>
</p>Hampering efforts is starting another new passion, coding. This webpage forms part of a portfolio created during Angela Yu's 
'Complete Web Development Bootcamp'. I'm 28 of 476 modules to complete, keen to do so but with Bedros is in my ear on multiple fronts ðŸ˜† 
    <p>
    
<p>Time to put in the work.</p>
